Other than sharing my works, I will also introduce the tools and softwares I have recently use to create these works, that includes devices and apps or as softwares.</p>
          <p>To see most of my works, you can go visit and have a look at the <a href="gallery.html">&quot;Gallery&quot;</a> page!</p>
        <p>Through out the page, I will also show the images and info of the tools, devices, and softwares I previously and currently use.        </p></td>

          <p><strong>What software did I use?</strong></p>
          <p>Throughout my digital art experience, I have used and tried on a few illustration softwares. As far I remember it was around five or six, they are CorelDRAW, Krita, Medibang, Clip Studio, and IbisPaint. Fortunately I will only be discussing about the ones I have often used, these will be ordered based on how often I use them.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>IbisPaint</strong></p>
              <p>I am currently using this app for my art content where my artworks are posted on Instagram. IbisPaint is a mobile drawing app which goes on with two versions; IbisPaint and IbisPaint X. Whats the difference? IbisPaint X is the free version of IbisPaint, having the app icon color blue, majority of mobile digital artists use this version of the app, most of the brushes are locked and can be unlocked by watching ads or you can import a custom brush from the internet. </p>
              <p>While the IbisPaint, the main one, is a paid version of the app with the color of the app icon black, all brushes are free to use and is free of ads. Its costs around USD$10 (Rp159000).</p>
              <p>Recently, Ibis has released a PC version which can be download through the microsoft app. There has been major updates made in 2023 by adding a new feature that many ibis users has been waiting for, one of the latest updates is animation.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Medibang</strong></p>
              <p>This is one of the first illustration softwares I have ever used and used to be my main software when I want to draw. Medibang or as Medibang Paint is another illustration software that works on both PC and mobile. It is a free to use software with many variant of brushes, tools and features. In my opinion, medibang paint has the same interface or layout design like CSP; Clip Studio Paint. It is easy to navigate and recommended for beginner digital artist who draws on PC. Medibang can be used for both normal illustration and making comic, hoever you need to sign up to have all your comic pages saved and can't be saved via local files. </p>
              <p>There are also various types of brushes and materials that can be downloaded online from the medibang website, some are free and some are not.</p>
              <p>A bit of info, Medibang has a clone called FireAlpaca, both have the same feature and layout but what differs between the two is that FireAlpaca has an Animation feature hich Medibang does not.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Clip Studio (CSP)</strong></p>
              <p>I have used Clip Studio a couple of times but only manage to complete two artworks since others are drafts and WIP (Work In Progress). Clip Studio is an advanced illustration software that is used widely among artist internationally. Unlike the previous two I mentioned, CSP (Clip Studio Paint) is a payed software to be able to get a licence code for CSP. CSP comes with two version, CSP Pro and CSP Ex. CSP has 3d objects used for referencing on figure poses and object persepectives, it is accessable on both version, including the free trial. CSP is free to download but not free to use since you will only get a 7 day trial of using the software, the downsides of the trial is that you cannot export and artwork.</p>
              <p>CSP Pro is a standard version where you only have access to make single artworks in one go, you are still able to get to make comics but can only make shorter ones like oneshots or a short comic strip. Animation is also available but can only make up to a few hundred frames limit. CSP Pro is the most prefered for standard artist - what I mean by standard artist are those who only draw one artwork.</p>
              <p>CSP Ex, I would say is a special version of CSP since all features are available and can be accessed. No limits on the number of pages you are going to illustrate for the comic and no limit on the number of frames. </p>

        <p><strong>What are the devices I use for Digital Art?</strong></p>
        <p>I have used  a few devices when I'm doing digital art, there are two type; a graphic tablet and a smart tablet. A drawing tablets or as better known graphics tablet is a tablet that will be connected to an another device such as computers, laptops, or even mobile phones. This type of tablet is used remotely where the pen does not touch the screen. While the other is just anotehr standard tablet that many people use for both privately and business, a samsung tablet which goes on with a stylus or as an S-pen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Wacom Intuos CTL-4100</strong></p>
            <p>The Wacom Intuos CTL-4100 tablet was where my digital art began. The Wacom Intuos CTL-4100 is a small variant of the Wacom Intuos series, it goes with a pen and replacement stylus tips placed inside the end of the pen, there are three of them. This goes on with a software where you have to download and install in order to have a more stable and smooth use of the tablet. Wacom offers free licence of different illustration softwares, for both MAC and Windows (e.g Clip Studio Paint)</p>
            <p>The area of the tablet is adjustable to make yourself comfortable upon using it.</p>
            <p>Is it worth it? It is worth buying for beginner and budget PC artists.</p>
            <p>Currently, the graphics tablet I have right now is used for a different purpose apart from illutrating with it.</p>

          <li>
            <p><strong>Samsung TabA6 Lite</strong></p>
            <p>The Samsung TabA6 Lite is just like any other ordinary samsung tablets that has a stylus with it. Since it uses android, there are various drwing apps that can installed, both free and payed apps.</p>
